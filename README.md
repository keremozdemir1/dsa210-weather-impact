# DSA210 - Weather Impact Analysis
📌 1. Project Objective
This project aims to analyze how weather conditions influence daily human activities. By examining daily temperature, precipitation, and other weather-related variables alongside external data such as social media trends, traffic congestion, or health records, I intend to uncover patterns and relationships between weather and human behavior.

📌 2. Data Sources
🔹 Weather Data 🌦️
Source: OpenWeather API or MGM (Turkish Meteorological Service)
Data Content: Daily temperature, precipitation, weather conditions (sunny, rainy, foggy, etc.), wind speed
🔹 Additional Data for Enrichment 🔍
Traffic congestion data (retrieved from Google Maps API)
Social media activity data (Twitter trends, number of Reddit posts, etc.)
Health-related data (disease rates, flu cases, etc.)
📌 3. Data Collection Process
Weather Data Collection: Data will be gathered using OpenWeather API.
Additional Data Collection: Enriched with external datasets from Google Maps API, Twitter API, or other relevant sources.
Data Cleaning & Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy) will be used for preprocessing, handling missing values, and structuring the dataset.
📌 4. Planned Analyses
Investigating the correlation between temperature and traffic congestion
Analyzing whether social media activity increases on rainy days
Studying the impact of weather fluctuations on public health (e.g., flu cases)
📌 5. Tools and Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
API Usage (OpenWeather, Google Maps, Twitter API, etc.)
Machine Learning (Regression models, time series analysis, etc.)
📌 6. Expected Outcomes
Understanding the impact of weather on daily activities and human behavior
Presenting insights through visualizations and statistical findings
Applying data science techniques to derive meaningful conclusions
