# DSA210 - Weather Impact Analysis 

## 1. Project Objective  
In this project, I will analyze how weather conditions affect people's daily activities.  
By looking at daily temperature, precipitation, and other weather-related data together with additional sources like social media trends or traffic congestion, I aim to find meaningful patterns in human behavior.

## 2. Data Sources  
### Weather Data  
- **Source:** [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) or [MGM (Turkish Meteorological Service)](https://www.mgm.gov.tr/)  
- **Collected Data:**  
  - Temperature  
  - Precipitation (rain, snow, etc.)  
  - Weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, stormy, etc.)  
  - Wind speed  

### Additional Data for Enrichment  
To make the analysis more meaningful, I will combine the weather data with other sources:  
- **Traffic Data** (Google Maps API) – To check if bad weather affects traffic congestion.  
- **Social Media Data** (Twitter, Reddit) – To analyze if people use social media more during bad weather.  
- **Health Data** (Public records) – To examine if weather has an effect on flu cases.

## 3. Data Collection Process  
- I will collect weather data using OpenWeather API.  
- For additional datasets, I will retrieve traffic data from Google Maps API and social media trends from Twitter or Reddit.  
- The collected data will be cleaned and structured using **Python (Pandas, NumPy).**

## 4. Planned Analyses  
- **Analyzing how different weather conditions affect traffic congestion levels.**  
- **Examining whether social media usage is higher on rainy days.**  
- **Studying the impact of temperature changes on flu cases.**

## 5. Tools and Technologies  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **APIs Used:** OpenWeather, Google Maps, Twitter API  
- **Machine Learning Techniques:** Regression models, time series analysis

## 6. Expected Outcomes  
- Understanding the relationship between weather conditions and daily human behavior.  
- Presenting insights through visualizations and statistical findings.  
- Applying data science techniques to derive meaningful conclusions.
